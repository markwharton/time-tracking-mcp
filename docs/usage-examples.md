# Usage Examples

Natural language examples for using Time Tracking MCP with Claude.

## Quick Start

Just talk to Claude naturally about your time:

```
You: "Just spent 2 hours on Conduit security review"

Claude: "Logged 2h for Conduit security review at 17:45

        Week 42 Status:
        ‚Ä¢ Total: 23.5h / 25h (94%)
        ‚Ä¢ Development: 18.0h / 20h (90%)
        ‚Ä¢ Meetings: 5.5h / 5h (110%) ‚ö†Ô∏è"
```

## Logging Time

## Natural Language Patterns

Claude understands various ways of expressing the same thing:

### Duration Formats

- **Hours:** "2h", "2 hours", "2.5h", "two hours"
- **Minutes:** "90m", "90 minutes", "ninety minutes"
- **Mixed:** "2 hours 30 minutes", "2h30m"
- **Casual:** "half an hour", "quarter hour"

### Time References

- **Absolute:** "at 14:30", "at 2pm", "at 2:30"
- **Relative:** "2 hours ago", "this morning", "yesterday afternoon"
- **Implied:** "just finished" (means now)

### Date References

- **Specific:** "2025-10-17", "October 17"
- **Relative:** "today", "yesterday", "last Monday"
- **Implied:** If no date mentioned, defaults to today

## Tips for Best Results

### Be Specific with Project Names

‚úÖ Good: "2h on Conduit MCP security review"  
‚ùå Vague: "2h on that thing"

### Use Consistent Tags

Stick to a set of tags for better tracking:
- `#development`, `#meeting`, `#admin`, `#review`, `#security`

### Check Status Regularly

Ask Claude for status throughout the week to stay on track:
```
You: "Quick status"
Claude: "You're at 23.5h / 25h (94%). You have 1.5h remaining this week."
```

### Combine Related Work

Instead of:
- "30m on email"
- "15m on email"
- "20m on email"

Do:
- "1h on email and admin" (log once at end of day)

### Use Natural Language

Don't try to match a specific format. Just tell Claude what you did:

‚úÖ "Just wrapped up a 2 hour meeting with the client about Q4 planning"  
‚úÖ "Been working on security review for about 90 minutes"  
‚úÖ "Yesterday I spent the afternoon (about 3 hours) on code review"

## Warning System

Claude will warn you when approaching or exceeding limits:

```
You: "2h on meeting"

Claude: "‚úì Logged 2h for meeting at 14:00

        Week 42 Status:
        ‚Ä¢ Total: 24.5h / 25h (98%) ‚ö†Ô∏è Almost at limit
        ‚Ä¢ Meetings: 5.5h / 5h (110%) üö´ OVER LIMIT

        You're at 98% of your weekly limit!"
```

## Editing Entries

If you need to edit an entry:

1. **Manual edit:** Open the markdown file and edit directly
2. **Replace entry:** Log the correct time, then manually remove the old entry
3. **Delete entry:** Open the markdown file and delete the line

Files are located at: `~/Documents/time-tracking/{company}/2025-W{N}.md`

### Flexible Duration Parsing

If you enable `FLEXIBLE_DURATION_PARSING=true` in your configuration, you can manually edit markdown files with more natural formats:

**You can use:**
- `(30m)` or `(30 minutes)`
- `(2h)` or `(2 hours)`
- `(90m)` or `(1.5h)`

**On next calculation, they normalize to:**
- `(0.5h)`
- `(2h)`
- `(1.5h)`

This makes manual editing easier while keeping files consistent.

## Example Workflow

A typical day's interaction:

```
Morning (9:15 AM):
You: "Started day with email and admin, about 45 minutes"
Claude: "‚úì Logged 0.75h for email and admin..."

Midday (12:30 PM):
You: "Just finished 2.5 hours on Conduit security review"
Claude: "‚úì Logged 2.5h for Conduit security review..."

Afternoon (3:00 PM):
You: "Quick status"
Claude: "You're at 8.5h / 25h (34%) this week..."

End of Day (5:45 PM):
You: "Last thing was a client meeting, 1 hour 45 minutes"
Claude: "‚úì Logged 1.75h for client meeting..."

You: "What's my total today?"
Claude: "Friday Oct 17: 5.0h (3 entries)"
```

## Multi-Company Workflow Example

Working across two companies in one day:

```
Morning (9:00 AM):
You: "hm 2h on Time Tracking MCP development"
Claude: "‚úì Logged to HeliMods: 2h for Time Tracking MCP..."

Afternoon (2:00 PM):
You: "stla 3h on integration testing"
Claude: "‚úì Logged to Stellantis: 3h for integration testing..."

Evening (5:00 PM):
You: "Status for HeliMods"
Claude: "HeliMods Week 42: 10.6h / 25h (42%)"

You: "Status for Stellantis"
Claude: "Stellantis Week 42: 28.8h / 25h (115%) üö´ OVER"
```

## Project Tracking

When you have projects configured, Claude automatically groups your time:

```
You: "2h on Time Tracking MCP refactoring"
# Automatically uses project tags: #development #mcp #typescript
# Shows up in project breakdown

You: "Status"
Claude: "üìä Week 42 Status

        By Project:
        ‚Ä¢ Time Tracking MCP: 6.4h
        ‚Ä¢ Conduit MCP: 12.0h"
```

This helps you see time distribution across your projects without manually tracking them.
