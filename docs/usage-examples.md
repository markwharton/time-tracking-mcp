## Natural Language Patterns

Claude understands various ways of expressing the same thing:

### Duration Formats

- **Hours:** "2h", "2 hours", "2.5h", "two hours"
- **Minutes:** "90m", "90 minutes", "ninety minutes"
- **Mixed:** "2 hours 30 minutes", "2h30m"
- **Casual:** "half an hour", "quarter hour"

### Time References

- **Absolute:** "at 14:30", "at 2pm", "at 2:30"
- **Relative:** "2 hours ago", "this morning", "yesterday afternoon"
- **Implied:** "just finished" (means now)

### Date References

- **Specific:** "2025-10-17", "October 17"
- **Relative:** "today", "yesterday", "last Monday"
- **Implied:** If no date mentioned, defaults to today

## Tips for Best Results

### Be Specific with Project Names

‚úÖ Good: "2h on Conduit MCP security review"  
‚ùå Vague: "2h on that thing"

### Use Consistent Tags

Stick to a set of tags for better tracking:
- `#development`, `#meeting`, `#admin`, `#review`, `#security`

### Check Status Regularly

Ask Claude for status throughout the week to stay on track:
```
You: "Quick status"
Claude: "You're at 23.5h / 25h (94%). You have 1.5h remaining this week."
```

### Combine Related Work

Instead of:
- "30m on email"
- "15m on email"
- "20m on email"

Do:
- "1h on email and admin" (log once at end of day)

### Use Natural Language

Don't try to match a specific format. Just tell Claude what you did:

‚úÖ "Just wrapped up a 2 hour meeting with the client about Q4 planning"  
‚úÖ "Been working on security review for about 90 minutes"  
‚úÖ "Yesterday I spent the afternoon (about 3 hours) on code review"

## Multi-Company Workflows

If you work with multiple companies, specify which one:

```
You: "2h on security review for helimods"
You: "Client meeting 1h for clientx"
You: "Status for helimods"
You: "This week's report for clientx"
```

Or set a default and only specify when different:

```
# Default is helimods
You: "2h on security review"  # ‚Üí logs to helimods
You: "1h meeting for clientx"  # ‚Üí logs to clientx
```

## Warning System

Claude will warn you when approaching or exceeding limits:

```
You: "2h on meeting"

Claude: "‚úì Logged 2h for meeting at 14:00

        Week 42 Status:
        ‚Ä¢ Total: 24.5h / 25h (98%) ‚ö†Ô∏è Almost at limit
        ‚Ä¢ Meetings: 5.5h / 5h (110%) üö´ OVER LIMIT
        
        You're at 98% of your weekly limit!"
```

## Editing Entries

If you need to edit an entry:

1. **Manual edit:** Open the markdown file and edit directly
2. **Replace entry:** Log the correct time, then manually remove the old entry
3. **Delete entry:** Open the markdown file and delete the line

Files are located at: `~/Documents/time-tracking/{company}/2025-week-{N}.md`

## Example Workflow

A typical day's interaction:

```
Morning (9:15 AM):
You: "Started day with email and admin, about 45 minutes"
Claude: "‚úì Logged 0.75h for email and admin..."

Midday (12:30 PM):
You: "Just finished 2.5 hours on Conduit security review"
Claude: "‚úì Logged 2.5h for Conduit security review..."

Afternoon (3:00 PM):
You: "Quick status"
Claude: "You're at 8.5h / 25h (34%) this week..."

End of Day (5:45 PM):
You: "Last thing was a client meeting, 1 hour 45 minutes"
Claude: "‚úì Logged 1.75h for client meeting..."

You: "What's my total today?"
Claude: "Thursday Oct 17: 5.0h (3 entries)"
